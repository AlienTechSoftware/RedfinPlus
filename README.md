# RedfinPlus
[redfin.com][rf-url] is a fantastic source of information on housing. Their [redfin-datacenter][rf-dc] is another great data source on trends and market research. I've used their website, and their agents to purchase my first house. 

This [RedfinPlus][rf+url] is a [Python 2.7][py-url] wrapper for [redfin.com][rf-url] apis. It helps run daily searches to find new houses, and apply your own score function to filter and sort search results. It also has a [tampermonkey][tm-git] web page enhancer that adds score funtion results and some missing information from ([AreaVibes][av-url] and [SpotCrime][sc-url]).
